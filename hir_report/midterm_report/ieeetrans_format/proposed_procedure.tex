\section{Proposed Procedure}
The first phase of the experiment will be conducted on a simulator using the robot model as shown in figure \ref{fig:model}. From the simulator, we expect to obtain the estimated data to determine the expected data on the robot and the optimal reinforcement learning parameters.

The second phase of the experiment will be conducted on the @home robot shown in figure \ref{fig:home}. Human subject guides the robot by applying adequate force to the robot arm. The experiment will examine the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Applying force to the end-effector when the robot arm is in a fixed position.
\item Applying force to the joint when the robot arm is in a fixed position
\item Applying force to the end-effector when the robot arm is in motion
\item Applying force to the joints when the robot arm is in motion
\end{enumerate}

The direction of the force applied will parallel to robot movement, push and pull. For experiment condition 3 and 4, the robotÅfs arm will move vertically every 10 second. Generating results and behavior is expected to occur every 0.1 second and the experiment will terminate when the subjects believe the robot behaves sufficiently or when 10 minutes has passed. This experiment will be expected to be performed by at least 5 subjects.
